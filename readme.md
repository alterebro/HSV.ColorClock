**HSV Color Clock** is a little experiment with the purpose of representing visually time by using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) Color Space representation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV ). It adheres to the following rules:

- Colors cannot repeat and each minute of the day should match a different color.
- 12.00 midday should match to White color (0% Saturation and 100% of Value).
- 00.00 midnight should correspond to Black color (0% Saturation and 0% Value).
- Color change has to be done gradually and no sudden big step should happen between contiguous minutes.
- Hue value will follow the rotation of the hours handler (0&deg;:red, 60&deg;:yellow, 120&deg;:green, 180&deg;:cyan, 240&deg;:blue, 300&deg;:magenta).

This experiment has been developed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript / jQuery by : **[@alterebro](https://twitter.com/alterebro)**
